I am sincerely honoured to have been selected as the recipient of the Marubeni India Meritorious Scholarship 2019-20 of â‚¹50,000 from Marubeni India Private Limited, New Delhi, India.

   By awarding this scholarship the Marubeni corporation has lightened my financial burden which allows me to focus more on the most important aspect of University, learning. Marubeni India generosity has inspired me to help others and give back to the community. I hope one day I will be able to help students to achieve their goals just as how Marubeni have helped me.
